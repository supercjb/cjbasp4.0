# CJB-ASP Forum 4.0

This project is an old-school artifact created using ASP over 20 years ago.

## About CJB-ASP Forum

CJB-ASP Forum, developed by [supercjb](mailto:supercjb@pie.com.tw), was an early ASP-based forum system aimed at providing a fully free, non-commercial forum solution in Traditional Chinese. Given the rarity of Taiwanese ASP forums, CJB-ASP was a pioneering project intended to serve as a simple, customizable, and freely available discussion platform for small communities.

## A Word from Supercjb

In today's internet landscape, forums are everywhere, including platforms like LB, ATNET, PHPBB, and DIUSZ. However, PHP-based forums are far more common than ASP-based forums. Outside of limited options like 動網論壇 and ATNET, there were few comprehensive ASP forums available, especially those developed independently by a Taiwanese programmer. CJB-ASP Forum was created out of personal interest and to fill this gap. It remains entirely free with no future plans for monetization and serves the community with a focus on providing robust features for small-scale forums.

I hope to see more people who want to give back to the community join the CJB-ASP development team. Currently, development is a solo effort, which means slower progress, but core functionalities are in place. By working together, we can breathe new life into this fully Taiwanese-made Traditional Chinese forum platform.
